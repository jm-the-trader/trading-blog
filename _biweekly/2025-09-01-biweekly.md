## Retrospect
Learned more about probabilities based on my readings from mastertradingflow. In summary here's what I've read or noticed:

1. The importance of understanding market context and not just relying on patterns. A.K.A situational awareness.
- EPs and BOs are typically stronger in a bullish market. August - September generally tend to be weaker months so it'd be best to be risk off right now.
2. Action after a breakout or EP.
- Flo (mastertradingflow) has classified EP / BO followthrough in 3 categories: chicken, duck and swan. Chicken patterns are sharp reversals after a breakout, duck patterns are sideways action and swan patterns are strong upward trends.
- The day of an EP, the price closes +/- 3% on the day of. Goes more than +/- 3% 53% of the time and never goes below the low of day within 20 day period 56% of the time.
- After an EP (Day 1 and onwards), 57% of the time the action is a duck pattern. 30% of the time it's a swan. 13% of the time it's a chicken.
3. The role of risk management in trading success.
- Ideally entering within the first 30 min. After 30 mins it just gets more risky. Stop losses should be the low of the day on the first 30 min +/- 1%. 10 MA is also good but I'd say it'd be better to use low of day as after a gap up, gap between 10 MA and low of day could be huge.
4. Profit taking.
- Pradeep Bonde and Qullamaggie have always said take profits 2-5 days after the strong move. After going through the analysis of Flo, it seems like 3~ days is the sweet spot. After 3 days, the probability of a pullback increases significantly. 83% of the time that highest profit day goes up to 10 days. 32% of the time it's within 1-4 days. 23.6% of the time it's on day 0.
- Tiered profit taking needs to occur into strength in 2-4 days. 25-50% is the sweet spot and then keep runners at break even. This is a must. Alternatively one could sell into strength then buy back on a dip but that becomes riskier and would need more stats & analysis. Tiered profit taking also helps with stocks running past day 7 - 10.

## To Do (Next 2 Weeks)
- Review 3 - 5 EPs a day
    - Classify them into chicken, duck, and swan patterns.
    - Classify the market context for each EP (bullish, bearish, or neutral).
    - Note the pattern, any news catalysts.


## Thoughts / Reflection
- I started reading up on https://www.mastertradingflow.com/. Great website and great analysis on EPs and BOs. I purchased his data set and wow it's so comprehensive and well-structured. It's helping me identify patterns and improve my trading strategy.
- Longer term I need to keep myself accountable to this blog & trading. I find that I always start something and never follow through with it. I really need to put in 10k hours before achieving mastery. From a high level the concepts are basic just like in Chess. In Chess it seems simple; you move the pawn 1 square forward, the bishop moves diagonally, and the rook moves in straight lines. In trading, you can easily buy and you can sell. But in chess, how do grandmasters achieve that type of mastery?

## Current Trading Rules
- Only enter initial positions within the first hour. Can add to existing positions later.
- Stop loss should be maximum <1% below the low of the opening 30m candle.
- Take profits 2-5 days after a strong move, with 3 days being the sweet spot.
- Only add to existing positions if they are in profit. Never average down.
- Use tiered profit taking: sell 25-50% into strength in 2-4 days, keep runners at break even.
- Have situational awareness: understand the market context and adjust strategies accordingly.
