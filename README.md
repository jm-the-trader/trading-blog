# Trading Journal Website

Welcome to your personal trading journal! This site is built with Jekyll for GitHub Pages and is organized for easy journaling and performance tracking.

## Structure

- **Home**: Welcome and about you/your trading journey.
- **Journal**: Blog-style posts for each trade or trading day.
- **Performance**: Charts or tables showing your trade results and stats.
- **Resources**: Useful links, tools, and reading material.
- **Contact**: How people can reach you.

## How to use

- Add new journal entries as markdown files in the `_posts` folder.
- Update performance data in the `_data/performance.yml` file or as markdown tables in the `performance.md` page.
- Add useful links to the `resources.md` page.
- Edit `about.md` and `contact.md` for your personal info.

## Getting Started

1. Edit the markdown files to personalize your journal.
2. Commit and push to your GitHub repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (choose the `main` branch and `/ (root)` or `/docs` folder).
4. Visit your site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
